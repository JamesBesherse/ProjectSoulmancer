      <h2 class="About_h2">About Project Soulmancer</h2>
      <p class="About_P">Project Soulmancer is my video game project. I aim to start working on it daily once the thought process is finished. I plan on it being a massive open world RPG with diverging story paths, an in-depth levelling system, a Soulmancer system where you can either absorb a soul of a creature to strengthen yourself, learn skills from creatures or use the soul in creating unique weapons, armour, potions or materials.</p>
      <p class="About_P">At the beginning you start as the apprentice of an old dying Soulmancer, the area you start is littered with goblins, wildlife, and other small creatures. past the beginning, the world is populated with Elves, Dwarves, passive Goblins, Humans, Beast people, and a variety of half breeds, and humanoid creatures that are eager to learn and co-exist with the rest of the world.</p>
      <p class="About_P">Your old master will teach you basic blacksmithing, alchemy, and crafting and tells you that you have to learn more complex technics from better artisans. Your master teaches you about “Living Gear” that grows with the souls you give it. You are given one recipe of your choice at the beginning such as Sword/Shield/Dagger/Staff/Bow to fit all archetypes. After you make a choice, your master scatters the rest of the recipes throughout the world via spirit beings, He tells you that you can find them anywhere from chests to a hollowed out tree trunk.</p>
      <p class="About_P">The main story will have an enemy hunt down Soulmancers deeming them unnatural and not of this world. You will travel from kingdom to kingdom to either get help in either help you with the enemy or information against them. You can help or destroy kingdoms with the diverging storylines.</p>
      <p class="About_P">There will be guilds and groups you can join. Like a genetic adventurer’s guild where you can hunt monsters or harvest plants to get money while getting souls to improve gear or strengthen yourself. There will also be an assassin guild, thieves’ guild, a hero’s guild where you need a lot of renown and the guild is tasked with fighting great threats such as a dragon burning villages. There will also be small groups that you can help, you never know that can play a large role in the story if done right.</p>
      <p class="About_P">Throughout your adventure you will learn about legendary beings of the past. You learn of their gear, their power. Down the line, you can find their tomb where they were buried with their gear and maybe an untouched soul to absorb or even create “Living Gear” versions of one of their gear.</p>
      <!--<p>Project Soulmancer is going to be a open world RPG. You start off as an apprentice for a old soulmancer. They will teach you about soulmancy. You will learn the basics of soul harvest and soul absorption. Soulmancers are being labeled as unnatural due to their soul absorption. Absorbing a soul can increase a soulmancer's abilities, let them learn skills from souls. Some soulmancers have created living weapons that absorb the souls of fallen creatures it has killed to slowly grow stronger.</p>-->
